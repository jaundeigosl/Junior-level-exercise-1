The Manchester United FC aims to launch its new FinTech project: It involves a platform that enables users to purchase a fan token called MUFC. Users can utilize this token to acquire tickets to the Old Trafford museum, tours, match tickets, and it can also be exchanged for merchandise in the club store. To drive this project forward, they decide to hire two software engineers (one front-end and one back-end). The platform should possess the following features:

The platform must have an user registration system where personal data such as Name, Surname, date of birth, country, city, full address, and other necessary information are stored. Additionally, the user should be able to recover their password if forgotten and must have 2FA. If a user registers with another user's referral code, both will receive 5 MUFC.
